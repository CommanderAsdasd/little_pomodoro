A little pomodoro timer for my own needs, with note for each timed session.

TODO: Statistic, async timer setting. Maybe get rid of `click` to make more portable
TODO: Checking and managing tasks+
TODO: Make a config to define notes file
TODO: Split MVC, classes to files

# Installation:

`pipenv install`

then `pip install pipenv-shebang` should be installed globally.
